HUNTER X HUNTER FIGHTING GAME

TODO:
Button Engine:
-determines which buttons are entered
-determines how long inbetween presses
-using above info, determines which action to pursue
-constantly polls keyboard
-constantly streams info back to main controller
-use a FSM as a possible encoding for attacks. might migrate this to character engine; we’ll see
Physics Engine:
-determines location of all characters on screen
-determines if in or out of bounds
-determines movement of characters
-determines if attack is within hitbox parameters
-determins any acceleration/velocity changes in movement due to attacks/actions (like jumps or throws)
Character Engine:
-determines attack points of characters
-determines health of characters
-changes health depending on attacks
-unique profiles for all characters
-keeps track of character specific “stances” in order to keep track of special stance moves
-characters also potentially have their own specific engines to work off of
Stage Engine:
-similar to the character engine but for stage flags and triggers
-for example, walls, wall breaks, and so on
-affects the physics engine and the character engine in terms of potential movement area as well as health modifiers
Match Engine:
-keeps track of current runtime of match
-keeps track which characters are on field
-keeps track of which characters play in which round and adjusts character profiles for each round
-keeps track of game state (win/lose/in progress/etc)
Controller Engine:
-recieves all the outputs of the above engines as input
-outputs engine flags and above engines use these flags as input to update their respective and internal game state
