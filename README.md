# ARENA Ã— H
A Hunter X Hunter fighting game based off of the Design Doc provided by Reddit user goshoryuu (who also happens to be a good friend.)

The motivating factor to actually implement this game is because I'm going to being heading back home to the Philippines...which is a 15 hour flight from SFO. This is PERFECT for a mini hackathon; hope you enjoy ;)
